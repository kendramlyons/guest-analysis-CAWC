# guest-analysis-CAWC
*** Guest stats report for Casa Alitas Welcome Center ***
This analysis was performed during an internship at the volunteer run Help Desk initiative at a migrant shelter in Tucson, Arizona.
The goal was to better understand the population being served at the shelter in order to improve services. Trends analyzed include 
country of origin, destination state, group size, duration of stay and daily shelter arrivals over time. 

*** Privacy Statement ***
Because some of the data collected about people who arrive at the shelter is of a personal or sensitive nature, raw data will not be stored 
in this repository. All data in this repository will be pre-processed to anonymize it and remove sensitive or irrelevant columns.
